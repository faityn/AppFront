Since its establishment in 2006, APP has developed into a company that leads atmospheric pressure plasma technology with technologv development, challenge consciousness and enthusiasm for creation. The recent technological environment of semiconductors, displays, and parts materials requires demanding parts and ultrafine patterns as required for large data transmission, and requires a powerful eco-friendly surface treatment / nanoprocessing / nano thin film solution that can be easily used in continuous processes (In line processes). APP has developed and supplied various Arp solutions (atmospheric low temperature Ar plasma) through innovation for over 20 years.\n\n -Eco-friendly / High-quality surface treatment solution\n -Ultrafine nanoprocessing solution\n -Ultrafine nano thin film solution\n\n We are providing backs in a continuous process. The plasma technology that APP is making is not a big, heavy expert technology, but a simple, easy technology for users. This allows customers to use the technology of $1 for a value of $10. Our APP always offers value in a creative, challenging spirit,We will become a company that leads change. Thank you.",

Therefore, executives, CEOS, as well as R&D, Manufacturing, C/S, Marketing, sales, HR, and Management support staff are engineers. To create 0 value of 10 dollars at the cost of one dollar is engineering, and  to create a value Of 100 dollars at the cost Of 10 dollars is engineering. That means a mission, the identity of APP, and the essential value of pursuit. APP exists tO perform this mission. APP people create a value more than 10 dollars at the thought Of one dollar, action of one dollar, or communication of one dollar, doing best in performing their own roles and creating added value of APP engineering. APP pursues our rich life and environment, and at the same time, desires our work to be connected with our life. To create a value of 100 dollars at the cost of one dollar is the direction and road for growth which APP people must pursue. APP has a belief a firm belief in reuse by somebody or the value created and accumulated by APP, and a belief in recreation of a value more than 10 times.

The quality of the semiconductor is determined by how thinly and uniformly the thin film is applied, so it is one of the most important processes. In addition, because the thickness of the thin film is so thin, precise and detailed technology is required.\n\n Deposition is largely divided into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is mainly used for the deposition of metal thin films and does not involve a chemical reaction.\n\n In contrast, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a method of depositing particles formed by a chemical reaction of gas in the form of vapor with external energy applied to form a thin film of a conductor, insulator, or semiconductor. Can be used for all depositions.",
